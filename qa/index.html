      <ul><li>They are located in another state</li>
          <li>They are an <b>international</b> event, containing robots and students from around the world</li>
          <li>They don't require teams to qualify, just sign up</li>
          <li>They are very high skill and diversity</li>

      <ul><li>3 awards that can send a team to Worlds</li>
          <li>A chance to practice working in the intense, high energy environment that will be seen at Worlds</li>

          <li>A fun change of pace, setting, and environment</li>
          <li>An incentive to get a very competitive bot before the mid season</li>
